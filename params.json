It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"Menwiz","body":"# __MENWIZ__ yet another character LCD menu generator for aRDUINO\r\n\r\n* __(near) asynchronous__: the library does not take mu control while working; this is usefull if your sketch need to work while you are using menus\r\n* _simple to use__ (compact and simple code, ortogonal interface)\r\n* __user defined splash screen__ (optional): if you need to show something at startup; time elapsed is user defined.\r\n* __user defined callback screen__ (optional) activated after a user defined elapsed time since last button push. The menu gently leave the screen to the user sketch code, untill any button is pushed.  \r\n* __user-defined actions__ (callback routine) from inside the menu\r\n* __user defined variables__ when you set a value inside a menu, the value is changed also in the binded variable available to the sketch code\r\n* __built in 6 and 4-buttons modes__ the user can overload the  built-in mode, implementing its own navigation callback (e.g. 3-buttons mode, analog buttons, rotary encoders etc) \r\n* __EEPROM support__ to save and load variables from EEPROM non volatile mamory; it is possible to disable EEPROM support to spare some memory\r\n\r\n## Warnings\r\n* MENWIZ requires New LiquidCrystal (*) and Buttons libraries, enclosed with the package. The New LiquidCrystal allows to use 4 wires, 8 wires, I2C, serial and other LCDs. The use of New LiquidCrystal is beyond this \r\n  introduction\r\n* the examples are done for 20x4 I2C LCD. other interfaces and screen dimensions can be used accordingly with New LiquidCrystal interface (changing mode/interface does not affect library code, but only sketch code) \r\n* starting from 0.6.0 version, due to the EEPROM support, the sketch must include the file EEPROM.h (until you disable the EEPROM support)\r\n\r\nThe MENWIZ library is avalable at:\r\nhttps://github.com/brunialti/MENWIZ/downloads\r\n\r\nPlease visit also the following forum topic:\r\nhttp://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,99693.msg866553.html#new\r\n\r\nComments, advices and user experiences are welcome\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version number convention\r\n\r\n__version.subversion.build__\r\n*   __version__: 0=not officially released (check the latest available sources, the lib could work  not properly\r\n*   __subversion__ new functions, modified function interfaces\r\n*   __build__ bug fixing, minor internal changes\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe TEST_LIB zip file contains the library used to test the MENWIZ lib.\r\nI used what I felt to be \"standard\" libraries. \r\nShould you have some problem using yours actual libs, try using them\r\n\r\n(*) New LiquidCrystal is a replacement of the standard LiquidCrystal and LiquidCrystal_I2C libraries. it is more efficient and very well supported. The nice thing about the \"New LiquidCrystal\" library, is that it already supports a wide range of LCD controllers:\r\n* I2C base on the PCF8574 or compatible\r\n* 4bit and 8bit parallel\r\n* ShiftRegister: 3wire, 2wire, 1wire (beta)\r\nYou can load the latest version at:https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/wiki/Home\r\n\r\n"}
